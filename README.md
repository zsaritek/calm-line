# Calm-Line

Calm-Line is a small SwiftUI app that shows one quote a day.
Nothing more, nothing noisy.

You open the app, read a short quote, and move on with your day.

## What it does

- Shows a daily quote that stays the same throughout the day
- Lets you refresh and read a different quote if you want
- Save quotes to your favorites
- Share quotes easily
- Simple settings (haptics, author visibility)

---

## Why this app

Calm-Line was built as a lightweight SwiftUI project focused on:
- clean UI
- simple state management
- readable code
- finishing something small, properly

No over-engineering, no extra dependencies.

## Project structure
